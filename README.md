Tutors can be rated by paying students</br>

<h2>Broken</h2>
<h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Footer is stuck at the bottom of the viewport not the bottom of the page, no idea how to fix it I tried different mixes of footer CSS edit but nothing worked and deleting the footer makes is so no content is rendered</li>

  </ul>

<h2>Done</h2>
<h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a Student/ Teacher field to CustomUserModel to be used upon REGISTERING</li>
    <li>Cannot choose your role (Tutor/Student) upon registering, cannot figure out how to implement it properly</li>
    <li>Not BROKNE but needs changing, The Unfollow button and follow button on TeacherProfile student side are present at the same time side by side, change that to only display one at a time</li>
  </ul>
</h6>

<h2>Note</h2>
<h6>
  <ul>
    <li>DayView.cshtml implementation has the potential of not working in other time zones because of "timeIntervals.Day == DateTime.Now.Day" part</li>
  </ul>
